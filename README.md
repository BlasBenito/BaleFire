Quantitative analysis of Erica-Fire dynamics in Garba Guracha, Bale Mountains, Ethiopia

This is an stand-alone R workflow, where:


+  **data.RData** contains the required data.
+  **functions.R** contains the required functions to perform the analyses.
+  **code.R** is the script performing the whole analysis.
+  **Workflow.Rmd** describes and computes the analyses used in the manuscript "Long-term post-fire resilience of the Ericaceous Belt, Bale Mountains, Ethiopia" by Gil-Romera et al. and currently under revision in Biology Letters.
